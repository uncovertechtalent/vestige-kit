  Reference-verification gate. Hallucinated references (paths, commands,

  explicitly labelled unverified before the reply stands. Ships with a

# Guess gate

Scope, stated before the doctrine: confabulation is a provenance problem, not
a form problem, and no output scanner can detect a guess that carries no
checkable reference. The general fix is upstream: make provenance mandatory
at generation (answers built from a retrieved knowledge base, with sources),
so a claim without a source is flagged by construction instead of hunted
afterwards. That architecture is vault-kit's job. What this skill ships is
the narrow downstream complement: a spot-checker for references that ARE
locally checkable, aimed at the highest-damage slice, the final report, where
a path or name gets asserted to the human and no tool call ever verifies it.
In an agentic loop, executed references self-check when the next tool call
errors; asserted-but-never-executed references reach the human unverified,
and that is the slice this gate covers.

The mechanism, stated precisely: models mostly carry a usable internal
uncertainty signal (Kadavath 2022, "Language Models (Mostly) Know What They
Don't Know"), and approval training then rewards answering over abstaining,
because raters score "I don't know" as unhelpful. A guessed username is not a
capability failure, it is the fawn reflex applied to epistemics. You cannot
prompt it away (prose instructions decay; see the half-life result at
machinebehavior.io/experiments). You can gate it, at three rungs.

## Rung 1: deterministic reference checks (any model, shipped here)

Any reference class with an accessible ground truth gets checked mechanically:

| Class | Ground truth | Check |
|---|---|---|
| file paths | filesystem | exists |
| commands | PATH | `which` |
| usernames | roster / conversation | membership |
| quotes | the quoted file | grep |
| URLs, versions, API names | registry / repo / HTTP | resolve |

`hooks/guess-scan.js` implements paths (default on), commands and usernames
(opt-in via `~/.claude/guess-gate.json`). The bounce demands one of two exits:
correct the reference, or keep it with an explicit label (unverified /
planned / hypothetical). Deleting the claim to dodge the check is named as a
violation in the bounce text, because silent deletion is the same fawn move
one layer up.

The standing skill rule, for everything the hook cannot reach: **a factual
reference either carries its source or carries its label.** No third state.

## Rung 2: logit gates (open-weight models only)

Token-level entropy over a named-entity span is high when the model is
smearing probability across candidates (guessing) and low when it is
retrieving. If you serve your own model (llama.cpp, vLLM, Ollama with
logprobs), threshold it: entity spans above the entropy threshold get wrapped
in an unverified label automatically. Frontier APIs mostly do not expose
logits; this rung is the transparency dividend of small local models. They
guess more, but you can see them do it.

## Rung 3: sampling gates (black-box fallback)

Semantic entropy (Farquhar et al., Nature 2024): ask the same question N
times at temperature, cluster the answers by meaning (a small local model
clusters fine), and treat high cross-sample disagreement as a confabulation
marker. Works on any API at N-times cost. Reserve it for load-bearing facts;
rung 1 is free and catches the reference classes that hurt most in practice.

## Logging

Every hook hit lands in `~/.claude/guess-scan.log` with a timestamp. The log
is the dataset: after a month you know your model's reference-guess base
rate, which classes fire, and whether the rate moves across model versions.
Publish it; that is the difference between a vibe and a finding.
